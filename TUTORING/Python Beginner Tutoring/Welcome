Hello Everyone,
WELCOME TO PYTHON BEGINNER!

We will being soon, so here are some things you can do before we begin:
 1) Have you saved the Zoom Link, so you can easily access it every week?
 2) Have you joined the Google Classroom? Most of you have, but if you have not, please enter this class code to join: 2b4xaoe.
 3) If you have not, please fill out the Python Survey in Google Classroom. It will let me know where everyone stands before we begin.

 Thank you!
